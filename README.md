# tweets

### A temporary project, to find the representative tweets of a user.

Web Architecture:

Frontend is designing with AngularJS + Bootstrap, backend server is running on node.js.


To run on local server:

```
git clone
npm install
cd bin
node www
```

the server is listening on: http://localhost:3000

There are two methods I'm using to find the representative tweets.

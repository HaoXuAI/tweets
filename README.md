# tweets

### A temporary project, to find the representative tweets of a user.

Web Architecture:

Frontend is designing with AngularJS + Bootstrap, backend server is running on node.js. data visualized in d3.js.

A simple website UML:

Web Link:

http://13.59.231.130

or

http://ec2-13-59-231-130.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com


To run on local server:

```
git clone https://github.com/cmuhao/tweets.git
cd tweets
npm install
cd bin
node www
```

the server is listening on: http://localhost:3000

## preprocessing
I preprocess and tokenize the text by removing the http link, unrecognized character, stopwords, and some other meaningless words like "RT, &amp", and
username.

## Methods
### lexrank
lexrank method is using graph-based lexical centrality. The lexrank method consider all tweets as one document,
which means it consider relations between sentence, but that is not necessary. And since we don't have labels for
evaluating the result, I'm comparing it with the clustering result.

### clustering

Steps:

1. use ngram (n = 7) to decide the size of features of each sentence.
    1. here I've updated using word2vec to get vector representation of words. then average of Word2Vec vectors with TF-IDF.
    In that case you can skip step 2.
2. use TFIDF to weight each feature of sentence.
3. use k-means (k = 10) to do clustering.
4. after K-means finishes, select the closest sentence (most rep-
resentative sentence) to each centroid for composing the summary.

```

we can see the results of two methods are almost different, with only one intersection.

## keywords
Use TFIDF to find the representaive words of all tweets, represented by wordCloud.
